About The Script
--------------
This was made for a CodeDay hackathon as an easier way for me to manage dependencies and scripts in general. Basically, it uses a config file to define (in terms of individual python scripts) where python is installed, what version the script needs, where it is, and it allows you to define a command that will run a certain script so you don't have to worry about paths or copypasting files. Commands (multiple scripts in one to simplify multi-step processes) coming soon. Keep in mind this is probably really hacky and isn't meant to be able to scale that much, or be very efficient. It's meant to work, nothing more, nothing less.
